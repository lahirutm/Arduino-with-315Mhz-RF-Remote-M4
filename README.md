# Arduino-with-315Mhz-RF-Remote-M4
Connect Arduino with 315Mhz RF Remote M4 to control electric devices using remote controller

I have used Arduino Nano V3.00 and 315Mhz Momentory type 4CH RF Remote Receiver in this project to Switch On/Off two electricle device using same remote controller since it has 4 keys. 
Also you can modify this to controll 4 devices using same remote.

I used D4, D5, D6, & D7 to receive signals from remote receiver. D8 and D9 to out put signals for any electrical device to switch on/off. 
(Note: You need to use Relays to connect electrical devices)
